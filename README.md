## ✍️ Task Distribution and Code Review

Tasks were distributed based on complexity to ensure a fair workload.  
Each team member also performed peer review, which included:

- Functionality testing
- Adding comments and Pythonic docstrings ("""Explanation""")
- Implementing exception handling (`try`–`except` blocks)

| Team Member   | Main Responsibility | Peer Review Tasks |
