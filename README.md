# üêç Python Exam Project ‚Äì PGR107


This repository contains the source code for the PGR107 (Python Programming) Final Exam project, submitted in Spring 2025 at Kristiania University of Applied Science.


##  üë• Contributors

This project was completed as a group assignment by the following students:
- **Athiththiyan**  - Question 1
- **Elin**  - Question 2
- **Ivan**  - Question 3 and 4


## üìù Task Overview

The exam consisted of four individual programming tasks:

- **Q1: Word Guessing Game** - Implement a game where users guess letters to reveal a hidden word.
- **Q2: Library Management System** -  Implement classes to manage books and borrowing.
- **Q3: Bank Account Management System** - Simulate basic banking functions via CLI and OOP.
- **Q4: Palindrome Checker** -  Verify whether a user-entered string is a palindrome.


## ‚úçÔ∏è Task Distribution and Code Review

Tasks were distributed based on complexity to ensure a fair workload. Each team member also performed sub-review, which includeed:
- Funtionality testing
- Adding comments and Pythonic docstrings (`"""Explnation"""`) for all function/class
- Implementing exception handling (`try`-`except` blocks).

| Team member  | Main Responsiblity | Sub review Tasks |
| -------------| ------------------ |------------------| 
| Athiththiyan | Q1                 | Q2, Q3, Q4       |
| Elin         | Q2                 | Q1, Q3, Q4       | 
| Ivan         | Q3 + Q4            | Q1, Q2           | 


## ü§ù Team Collaboration & Workflow

While each member had clear implementation duties, our **collaboration was the key to success**:

- üîÄ **Version Control** ‚Äì GitHub was used for branching, commits, and merging with mandatory code reviews.
- ‚úÖ **Review Process** ‚Äì Each PR required **2 approvals** from peers before merging.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Clean Code Agreement** ‚Äì We aligned on naming conventions, modular functions, and readable logic to ensure consistency.

> üö´ **Note:** The `main` branch is protected.  
> All code contributions must be made via Pull Requests and require **2 approved peer reviews** before merging.  
> üìå See [Git Workflow](./GIT_WORKFLOW.md) and [Peer Review Process](./PEER_REVIEW_PROCESS.md) for details.

We believe this project reflects not only our **technical ability** but also our **professional team collaboration**, which we consider essential for real-world software development.
