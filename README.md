# 🐍 Python Exam Project – PGR107


This repository contains the source code for the PGR107 (Python Programming) Final Exam project, submitted in Spring 2025 at Kristiania University of Applied Science.


##  👥 Contributors

This project was completed as a group assignment by the following students:
- **Athiththiyan**  - Question 1
- **Elin**  - Question 2
- **Ivan**  - Question 3 and 4


## 📝 Task Overview

The exam consisted of four individual programming tasks:

- **Q1: Word Guessing Game** - Implement a game where users guess letters to reveal a hidden word.
- **Q2: Library Management System** -  Implement classes to manage books and borrowing.
- **Q3: Bank Account Management System** - Simulate basic banking functions via CLI and OOP.
- **Q4: Palindrome Checker** -  Verify whether a user-entered string is a palindrome.


## ✍️ Task Distribution and Code Review

Tasks were distributed based on complexity to ensure a fair workload. Each team member also performed sub-review, which included:
- Functionality testing
- Adding comments and Pythonic docstrings (`"""Explnation"""`) for all function/class
- Implementing exception handling (`try`-`except` blocks).

| Team member  | Main Responsibility | Sub-review Tasks |
| -------------| ------------------- |------------------| 
| Athiththiyan | Q1                  | Q2, Q3, Q4       |
| Elin         | Q2                  | Q1, Q3, Q4       | 
| Ivan         | Q3 + Q4             | Q1, Q2           | 


## 🤝 Team Collaboration & Workflow

While each member had clear implementation duties, our **collaboration was the key to success**:

- 🔀 **Version Control** – GitHub was used for branching, commits, and merging with mandatory code reviews.
- ✅ **Review Process** – Each PR required **2 approvals** from peers before merging.
- ✍️ **Clean Code Agreement** – We aligned on naming conventions, modular functions, and readable logic to ensure consistency.

> 🚫 **Note:** The `main` branch is protected.  
> All code contributions must be made via Pull Requests and require **2 approved peer reviews** before merging.  
> 📌 See [Git Workflow](docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md) and [Peer Review Process](docs/PEER_REVIEW_PROCESS.md) for details.

## 🎓 What We Learned

This project wasn’t just a programming exercise — it was a chance to experience real software teamwork. Through this process, we learned:

- How to manage GitHub collaboration with pull requests and protected branch
- The value of peer reviews in improving code quality and catching bugs early
- How to write clean, Pythonic code with documentation and modular structure
- The importance of clear communication, shared standards, and mutual trust
- How to split tasks fairly and hold each other accountable without losing team spirit

We’re proud not just of the result, but of how we worked together to get there.


## ✅ Notes

- All code follows the PGR107 final exam requirements and standard Python coding conventions.
- Each team member completed their assigned task(s) and contributed to peer review for at least two additional tasks.
- Plagiarism was strictly avoided, as per the exam regulations.


> **📄 Additional Documentation:**  
> The `README.md` file and the contents of the `docs/` folder were created voluntarily and were **not required by the exam**.  
> They were added to showcase our collaboration, professional workflow, and clear documentation practices — values we consider essential in software development.
