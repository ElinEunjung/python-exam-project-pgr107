## ✍️ Task Distribution and Code Review

Tasks were distributed based on complexity to ensure a fair workload.  
Each team member also performed peer review, which included:

- Functionality testing
- Adding comments and Pythonic docstrings ("""Explanation""")
- Implementing exception handling (`try`–`except` blocks)

| Team Member   | Main Responsibility | Peer Review Tasks |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Athiththiyan  | Q1                  | Q2, Q4            |
| Elin          | Q2                  | Q1, Q3            |
| Ivan          | Q3 + Q4             | Q1, Q2            |
