# üêç Python Exam Project ‚Äì PGR107


This repository contains the source code for the PGR107 (Python Programming) Final Exam project, submitted in Spring 2025 at Kristiania University of Applied Science.


##  üë• Contributors


This group project was completed by the following students:
- **Athiththiyan**  - Question 1
- **Elin**  - Question 2
- **Ivan**  - Question 3 and 4

## üìù Task Overview

The exam consisted of four individual programming tasks:

- **Q1: Word Guessing Game** - Implement a game where users guess letters to reveal a hidden word.
- **Q2: Library Management System** -  Implement classes to manage books and borrowing.
- **Q3: Bank Account Management System** - Simulate basic banking functions via CLI and OOP.
- **Q4: Palindrome Checker** -  Verify whether a user-entered string is a palindrome.


## ‚úçÔ∏è Task Distribution and Code Review

Tasks were distributed based on complexity to ensure a fair workload. Each team member also performed sub-review, which includeed:
- Funtionality testing
- Adding comments and Pythonic docstrings (`"""Explnation"""`) for all function/class
- Implementing exception handling (`try`-`except` blocks).

| Team member  | Main Responsiblity | Sub Review Tasks|
| -------------| ------------------ |-----------------| 
| Athiththiyan | Q1                 | Q2, Q4          |
| Elin         | Q2                 | Q1, Q3          | 
| Ivan         | Q3 + Q4            | Q1, Q2          |
